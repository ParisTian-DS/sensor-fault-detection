# Sensor-Fault-Detection

### Problem Statement
The Air Pressure System (APS) plays a crucial role in heavy-duty vehicles by utilizing compressed air to move a piston, which in turn applies pressure to the brake pads, ultimately bringing the vehicle to a stop. 

This is a Binary Classification problem, in which the affirmative class indicates that the failure was caused by a certain component of the APS, while the negative class indicates that the failure was caused by something else.

### Solution Proposed 
This project specifically targets the Air Pressure system (APS), which is responsible for producing pressurized air used in various functions of a truck, including braking and gear changes. The dataset used in this project defines the positive class as component failures within a specific component of the APS system, while the negative class pertains to truck failures related to components not associated with the APS system.

The problem is to reduce the cost due to unnecessary repairs. So it is required to minimize the false predictions.
## Tech Stack Used
1. Python 
2. FastAPI 
3. Machine learning algorithms
4. Docker
5. MongoDB

## Infrastructure Required.

1. AWS S3
2. AWS EC2
3. AWS ECR
4. Git Actions

## How to run?
Before we run the project, make sure that you are having MongoDB in your local system, with Compass since we are using MongoDB for data storage. You also need AWS account to access the service like S3, ECR and EC2 instances.

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ParisTian-DS/sensor-fault-detection.git
```

### Step 2- Create a conda environment after opening the repository

```bash
conda create -n sensor python=3.7.6 -y
```

```bash
conda activate sensor
```

### Step 3 - Install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4 - Export the environment variable
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>

export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<AWS_DEFAULT_REGION>

export MONGODB_URL=""

```

### Step 5 - Run the application server
```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 6. Train application
```bash
http://localhost:8080/train

```

### Step 7. Prediction application
```bash
http://localhost:8080/predict

```
